Web Design and Development (WAD) Assignment

This is my assignment of WAD which required us to use HTML, CSS and javascript. The part that covered by me are home page, about us, FAQ, LiveChat and static information pages.

The goal of this website is to promote Aromatherapy Products towards our Malaysia as people in Malaysia rarely know that it can help to reduce stress and make people relax with the scent and also increase the sales of  the products. This website has well-organized content for easy viewing of all the details of the products and other information such as Scentedâ€™s story and ways to read user diffuser and so on
